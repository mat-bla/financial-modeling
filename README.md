Some basic python programs to get started in data analysis for finance. Built with spyder and anaconda,
so I'd recommend using these.

I obvioulsy wouldn't recommend you try and use these for any real world investing or trading as I'm 
mainly doing this to improve my own ability and the code could well be full of nasty bugs that dispay 
incorrect data.

YahooCandles.py: This is the most basic program, which just pulls market data from Yahoo Finance and displays it 
in a candlestick chart. 


3charts.py: Display three charts side by side, along with the daily trading volume and RSI. Can be useful to quickly compare
different assets/markets. Again this just pulls market data from Yahoo.
